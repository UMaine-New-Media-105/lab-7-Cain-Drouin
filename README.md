1. Create a sketch in which you draw a shape (such as a circle) that diagonally stretches across the canvas from the top-left to the bottom-right and then from the top-right to the bottom-left. Therefore, essentially creating an "X".  Create an array of colors and then use the random function to randomize the color of each shape in the diagonal. Make sure to use at drawing at least 15 shapes.

2. Remember the first assignment of creating a grid of squares/circles? Great! Draw that but just draw a grid of shapes, no need to have your initial in the grid. Also, be sure to apply a gradient. Hint: Use nested loops.



3. Duplicate your previous sketch and modify it to add mouse interactivity. It could be something like changing the gradient based on the mouse's coordinate, changing shape on mouse click, or dropping a random row of icons on top of already present rows.
